# Swift-String-Extensions

I find strings and characters a pain to deal with. 

Due to the nature of modern `String`s containing more than just ASCII characters. Handling strings properly can 
become complicated, and the processes involved hard to remember. I am collecting extensions on Strings here to help
alleviate this problem.
